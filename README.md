# nian
*nian* is a text-adventure game created for **CS4040 Game Design and Simulation** at NCSSM. It is based on the Chinese myth of the Nian beast and New Year customs. Find the storyboard for this game here: [*Spoilers Storyboard](https://imgur.com/a/lLjb3xO)

This code is separated into three files: `items.json`, `rooms.json`, and `main.py`. The `.json` files contain item and room data for the game, while `main.py` processes input and parses json data to create the game.

Note from Bryan:  
<sub>The structure of `items.json` wasn't thought through very well in the initial planning of the game, which made item searches/inventory checks very inefficient. For the purposes of the game, it works.
